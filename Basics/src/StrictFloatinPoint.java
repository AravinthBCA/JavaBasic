//Java strictfp keyword ensures that you will get the same result on every platform 
//if you perform operations in the floating-point variable. The precision may differ from platform 
//to platform that is why java programming language have provided the strictfp keyword, so that you get
//same result on every platform. So, now you have better control over the floating-point arithmetic. 

//it use only class, methods and interface.
//not allow to use abstract,variable and constructor.
